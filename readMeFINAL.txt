The software is overall rpretty easy to use. Start the program and you'll be met with several options with what you want to do.
You can add one individual integer of your choice, add a bunch or random numbers up to a maximum value, sort the integers,
Look for a specific number and see if it's there, ask for a random number for the list, or print the whole list out entirely.

The recursive binary search allows you to ask for a specific number and the program will print it over and over for every position.
The iterative binary search will run on a while loop and look for the number and stop once it prints the number, showing every number until the program finds it.

A change I would've liked to make was to combine some functions if we could. This would make the code easier to go through and less tedious to debug and add to.
It definitely would've helped me work faster since I don't need to go through so much small text at once.
